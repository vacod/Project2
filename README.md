# Bouncy Balls

## Project Directive

Create sketch that includes your own custom class. It utilizes an array of class 
instances to build a moving system of objects that each have their own collision logic.

## Project Description

This programm shows many moving balls with random metallic colors moving
moving from random locations at random speeds. These balls are created with rings of color 
gradients thus creating a 3D effect. Each ball is an instance from the class Ball(). This
class creates a ball at a random location and controls its movement in a defined random 
direction. The ball is programmed to bounce of the walls of the screen. A ball can be 
selected (left mouse click) and mouse dragged to another location of the screen.
